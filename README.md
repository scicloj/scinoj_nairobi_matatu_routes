# Scinoj Nairobi Matatu Routes

In December 2024, the Kenyan government proposed changes to existing bus routes
in a gazette notice. The stated reasons for these changes are:

- reducing congestion in Nairobi's CBD (Central Business District) by limiting
  routes that use it as a transit point
- reducing travel times between different parts of Nairobi

The purpose of this project is to investigate whether these claims are true and
to further assess the impact on other aspects of the transportation network.
Additionally it is meant to serve as a demonstration of [Noj][4] for data and science.
